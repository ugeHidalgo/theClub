#theClub new web site

This is a demos for the new web site for the #theClub triatlon team.
Actually this is a demo because I´m using this to try different solutions using ASp.Net to create this site.

The idea is to have a site in which members of the club can register, and create his own profile, including:

  Personal data.
  Clothes sizes.
  Races that they are going to take part.
  etc..
  

The site will include:

  Information about the club.
  Information about activities.
  Information about sponsors.
  A point where users can made his team clothes orders.
  A pòint where users can register his results in competition calculating points asociated to his marks.
